								<p>Jayeeta Basu started her own research group at NYU in January of 2015. Exploring questions such as: why do we remember only a fraction of the things, places, events, or people we experience? How do our previous experiences stored in the brain as memories shape the perception of ongoing sensory experiences? 
The Basu laboratory’s research aims to examine mechanisms of learning and memory in the mammalian brain. 

Dr. Basu believes that science, like art, is a medium for creative expression. Her lab participated in the Ligo Project where artists in residence create their own graphical and musical renditions of the research happening at the Basu lab. As a founding member of NYU NeuWrite, Jayeeta is also passionate about fostering knowledge about the brain in the non-scientific community and bringing the next generation of young curious minds to the frontlines of scientific discovery.</p>
