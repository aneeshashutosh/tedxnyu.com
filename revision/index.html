                          We invite you to the 8th Annual TEDxNYU Conference: Re-Vision.
                          This year's theme invites us to look at the world around us and reflect
                          on the direction our society is heading. What is the future we envision <br/>
                          and are we on the path to get there? This year, our speakers will bring
                          you into the paths they have forged to achieve their re-vision of the world.
                          Together, let's reflect and ask ourselves: are we happy with what we see? <br/>

                <h4>Ayman Mukerji</h4>
                <h6>Mindfulness teacher, and neuroscience researcher at NYU Langone Medical School</h6>
                <img src="../images/events/revision/Ayman.jpg" width="20%" height="auto">
                <br/><br/>
                <p>
                  Ayman Mukerji Househam is on a mission to create a mindful world by demystifying
                  the biological benefits of mindfulness.
                  Ayman is a former Wall Street executive. She is a long time meditator, and now
                  teaches mindfulness to families, corporations and individuals. With a degree in
                  Physics, Ayman has always tried to answer life’s questions using quantum physics.
                  With her research on mindfulness physiology (or as the academics call it -
                  “psychoneuroimmunology”!), she finds answers to some of those questions. Her
                  recent scientific publications unravel how mindfulness practice changes our
                  immune system, gut and even our genes! She wants the world to hear the science
                  behind the buzzword. Ayman hopes to propagate mindfulness and eventually create
                  a peace movement.
                  Ayman teaches mindfulness workshops at the Rubin Museum of Art, the Tibet
                  House, to corporate clients and individuals. A clinical therapist in-training, Ayman
                  combines Eastern meditation with Western therapeutic techniques. She spends half
                  of her time publishing scientific papers to show the efficacy of mindfulness as an
                  intervention. She is an active speaker on the topic. Ayman is an author of a book on
                  the neural underpinnings of autism spectrum disorder. She works with children
                  diagnosed with autism and ADHD.
